SIBI Sign Language Detection

Language is a system used by an individual or members of a community to communicate with each other. As a communication tool, language is crucial for conveying ideas, thoughts, and other information, both orally and in writing. Without language, it would be very difficult for humans to express their desires.

Language comes in various types, ranging from the diversity of languages spoken in different countries to languages designed for individuals with special needs. Sign language is one such type of language that prioritizes manual communication, involving body language and lip movements, and does not use sound.
