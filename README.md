SIBI Sign Language Detection

Language is a system used by an individual or members of a community to communicate with each other. As a communication tool, language is crucial for conveying ideas, thoughts, and other information, both orally and in writing. Without language, it would be very difficult for humans to express their desires.

Language comes in various types, ranging from the diversity of languages spoken in different countries to languages designed for individuals with special needs. Sign language is one such type of language that prioritizes manual communication, involving body language and lip movements, and does not use sound.

The Indonesian sign language is divided into two types, namely SIBI and BISINDO. "BISINDO is a language that naturally developed within the Indonesian Deaf community, while SIBI is a set of procedures for representing spoken Indonesian language into specific movements," said Adi Kusumo Baroto, Sign Language Researcher from the Sign Language Research Laboratory, Faculty of Cultural Sciences, University of Indonesia, to Tempo on Monday, July 8, 2018 ("Sign Language SIBI and Bisindo, Examining the Differences"). It can be concluded that SIBI is a formal sign language, while BISINDO is a non-formal sign language ("BISINDO and SIBI: What's the Difference?").

According to the Deaf Federation, the number of deaf individuals worldwide reaches 72 million, with 80 percent residing in developing countries and using 300 different sign languages. In Indonesia, the number of deaf individuals is 223,655, and there are 73,560 deaf-mute individuals (Susesnas 2012). Sign language barriers are faced by deaf women and girls at almost every stage when accessing services and justice. This starts from families feeling ashamed and viewing deaf women and girls as asexual, limited capacity of service providers to offer interpreters, insufficient availability of counseling services, law enforcement officials not understanding the specific needs of deaf individuals, to the negative societal stigma perceiving deaf women and girls as disabled beings deprived of their full human rights.

Therefore, the development of the SIBI Sign Language Detection Application is intended for use within the context of hospital environments, aiming to support smooth communication between patients with limitations and doctors or nurses.

This program is the solution to that significant problem that translates SIBI sign language to Bahasa Indonesia which also the implementation of Artificial Intelligence with computer vision as the domain and using LSTM as the model. This program allows communication between patients and health practitioner to be freely and inclusive.
